### Building a Molecule
Building a molecule can be done in any program you choose. But the input file has to be in .xyz format.

### Performing a optimization with Orca
To perform the first optimization you need the .xyz file of your molecule and a input file which tells Orca what to do. The input file should look a bit like this:
```
orca.inp
! BP def2-SVP def2/J Opt UKS
%pal
nprocs 16
end

%geom
Constraints
{D 23 10 11 12 270.0 C } # D for Dihedral angle
end
end

* xyzfile 0 1 test.xyz
```
Additionally to the optimization, we lock the dihedral angle of the R-N-N-R bond at 270Â°. This is to simplify further calculations. We also read in the xyz-file in the same directory called test.xyz. For Orca calculations the **index of atoms start at 0!**

### Performing a dihedral scan
After the pre-optimization has concluded, we can start the dihedral scan around the R-N-N-R dihedral. To do this we set up 4 new calculations:

Calculation | multiplicity | angle
--- | --- |  --- |
1 | singlet| 270 -> 180 
2 | singlet | 270 -> 360
3 | triplet | 270 -> 180 
4 | triplet | 270 -> 360

Each calculation uses the optimized structure and a input file looking like this:
```
orca.inp
! BP def2-SVP def2/J Opt UKS
%pal
nprocs 16
end

%geom Scan
D 23 10 11 12 = 270, 180, 30
end
end

* xyzfile 0 1 orca_opt.xyz
```
This input file corresponds to the first calculation in the table above. 
`D 23 10 11 12 = 270, 180, 30`
We once again defined our dihedral angle and defined that we would like to scan the angle from 270 to 180 in 30 steps.
`* xyzfile 0 1 orca_opt.xyz`
We also read the xyz-file, depending on the multiplicity of the calculation either a 1 or 3 is written here. (1:singlet, 3:triplett)

### Combining your molecule with a fragment
Your Molecule is cofined on a larger polymer backbone. To simulate the effects of this backbone we combine your molecule with a part of the backbone. There are again multiple ways to do this, Gaussview or any other. 
This new structure is optimized using a gaussian calculation.
```

```
Diffent than in Orca we do not need a dedicated input file, all the instructions as well as the coordinates are provided in a .com file like above.

### Using Amber to prepare the Gromacs calcualtion
We will use AmberTools to prepare our input files for the Gromacs calculation.
If you do not have a AmberTools installation we will use one provided via a conda package.
To get this environment up and running you can follow [THIS](http://ambermd.org/GetAmber.php) instruction.

Now that you have a  working AmberTools installation your can activate it by writing `conda activate AmberTools23` in your console.
Next we execute 2 commands:
`antechamber -fi gout -fo prepi -c resp -i gauss.log -o amber.prep -rn F1 -at gaff2`
`parmchk2 -i amber.prep -f prepi -o amber.frcmod`
For this to work your Gaussian out file (.log) has to be in the directory you try to run this script.

If everything worked you will notice that a few new files appeard. We are interested in the `NEWPDB.PDB`-file. This file contains your molecule from bevore which we have to place in a unitcell. You can do this by using the `pbc box` command to show the cell and then defining the parameters with `pbc set {x y z} -all`. This requieres some trial and error, the full documentation can be found [HERE](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/pbctools/).

Now that we have definde the unitcell, we can multiply our molecule using another AmberTools plugin. With the command `PropPDB -p SHIFTED.PDB -o NEWPDB4x4.PDB -ix 1 -iy 4 -iz 4` we create a 1x4x4 meaning 16 copys of our molecule. It is important, that there is no 2nd layer below, meaning where your chain would be.

Next we run `tleap -f tleap.in` which combines some of our previously created files. The mentioned `tleap.in` looks like this:
```
#tleap.in
source leaprc.gaff
loadAmberPrep amber.prep
loadamberparams amber.frcmod
SYS = loadpdb NEWPDB4x4.PDB
SaveAmberParm SYS System.prmtop System.inpcrd
quit
```

Lastly we convert the `System.prmtop` and `System.inpcrd` files into gromacs input files using the `parmed` libary in python.
```python
import parmed as pmd

amber = pmd.load_file('System.prmtop', 'System.inpcrd')

# Save a GROMACS topology and GRO file
amber.save('System.top')
amber.save('System.gro'
```
