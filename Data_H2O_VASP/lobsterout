WARNING: You are using a fully symmetrized k-point grid. If you don't know what that means
WARNING: stop here and check the manual. Please Prepare a k-point grid that spans EITHER the whole
WARNING: Brillouin zone (i.e. without symmetry) or half of the Brillouin zone 
WARNING: (i.e. only time reversal symmetry) and restart your quantum-mechanical calculation
WARNING: and try again!

initializing Augmentations...
recommended basis functions:
H 1s 
O 2p 2s 
initializing LCAO system...
setting up local basis functions...
 H (Bunge) 1s 
 O (Bunge) 2s 2p_y 2p_z 2p_x 
INFO: There are more PAW bands than local basis functions available.
INFO: To prevent trouble in orthonormalization and Hamiltonian reconstruction
INFO: the PAW bands from 7 and upwards will be ignored.
setting up CO interactions...
WARNING: You did not specify any COHP pairs in the lobsterin file. As default
WARNING: I will try to find any pairs between 1.0 and 3.0 A distance,
WARNING: but that might be wrong. If you want pCOHPs or pCOOPs, change the lobsterin!
 found 3 interactions.
projecting...
WARNING: Cannot use the tetrahedron method for k-space integration and must fall
WARNING: back to Gaussian smearing which can take significantly longer. Make
WARNING: sure to use the tetrahedron method whenever applicable.
